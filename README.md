# TeamBeds
A Minecraft Data Pack for picking a team by sleeping in a bed! 🛏

*Tested in 20w13b though it should work for any Minecraft Java Edition version 1.13+*

# Colors and Customization
By default, the beds are mapped to chat colors like so:
* `minecraft:white_bed` -> `white`
* `minecraft:orange_bed` -> `gold`
* `minecraft:magenta_bed` -> `dark_purple`
* `minecraft:light_blue_bed` -> `aqua`
* `minecraft:yellow_bed` -> `yellow`
* `minecraft:lime_bed` -> `green`
* `minecraft:pink_bed` -> `light_purple`
* `minecraft:gray_bed` -> `dark_gray`
* `minecraft:light_gray_bed` -> `gray`

These can be changed either in `TeamBeds/data/teambeds/functions/load.mcfunction` or ingame by using `/team modify`

Additionally, the teams have no display name by default, but that can be changed ingame also by using `/team modify`
